Scan ticket,Change number of bags,-,-,-,"The ""Change number of bags"" activity requires information obtained from scanning the ticket. This is a data dependency, making it impossible to change the bag number before the system knows which ticket it's associated with."
Scan ticket,Change seat,-,-,-,"You need the information from the ticket scan (passenger ID, current seat assignment) to change their seat. This is a data dependency."
Scan ticket,Check validity of documents,-,-,-,-
Scan ticket,Weigh baggage,-,-,-,-
Scan ticket,Cancel check-in,-,-,-,Data dependency:  You need the ticket information (obtained by scanning) to determine if it's valid and whether cancellation is necessary.
Scan ticket,Process payment,-,-,The airline enforces the order to ensure payment is secured before finalizing the check-in process. This is a rule specific to the airline and not a legal requirement or industry-wide best practice.,"Processing payment likely requires information about the passenger and their luggage, which is obtained during the ticket scanning. This creates a data dependency where payment processing cannot be completed without information from the ticket."
Scan ticket,Check-in luggage,-,-,The airline mandates scanning tickets before luggage check-in to ensure payment processing and minimize cancellation issues. This rule is specific to their process and not a legal requirement or industry-wide best practice.,"Data Dependency: Check-in relies on information from the scanned ticket (number of bags, weight allowance, etc.).  The system cannot process luggage without this data."
Scan ticket,Load luggage,-,-,-,You cannot load the luggage onto the correct aircraft without knowing its destination and associating it with the correct passenger. This information is obtained by scanning the ticket and retrieving passenger data.  The loading process is dependent on the data output of the scanning process.

Change number of bags,Weigh baggage,-,-,-,-
Change number of bags,Cancel check-in,-,-,-,-
Change number of bags,Process payment,-,-,"The airline chooses to allow baggage changes for an additional fee, indicating a business decision rather than a legal requirement or best practice.",-
Change number of bags,Check-in luggage,-,-,"The airline requires payment for extra bags before check-in, prioritizing revenue collection and a smoother process by minimizing last-minute payment issues.",-
Change number of bags,Load luggage,-,-,-,"Luggage cannot be loaded onto the aircraft without being registered in the system, which happens when the number of bags is finalized. This represents both a resource dependency (system information) and a logical dependency (finalizing bag count before loading)."

Change seat,Weigh baggage,-,-,-,-
Change seat,Cancel check-in,-,-,-,"This is likely due to a data dependency. To cancel a check-in, the system needs to have the most up-to-date information, including any seat changes. This ensures a smoother process and prevents errors."
Change seat,Process payment,-,-,The airline has established a rule to process seat change fees before check-in and final payment to ensure revenue collection.,-
Change seat,Check-in luggage,-,-,"The airline chooses to allow seat changes, indicating a rule they control. It's not a law or presented as a universal best practice.","While not a strict law, it's logically easier to change seat assignments before luggage is processed and physically handled. Changing it later could necessitate retrieving and re-tagging luggage, causing logistical issues."
Change seat,Load luggage,-,-,-,-
Check validity of documents,Weigh baggage,-,"The text suggests flexibility in the order of activities, indicating it's not law or a strict rule. Checking documents first is mentioned as a way to avoid wasted time, suggesting a best practice for efficiency.",-,-
Check validity of documents,Cancel check-in,-,-,-,You cannot cancel a check-in that has not been deemed invalid first. This represents a logical dependency where checking validity is a pre-requisite to canceling.
Check validity of documents,Process payment,-,-,"The text states, ""If the ticket is not valid, or the passport is not valid, we can cancel the whole process and I don’t waste my time."" This indicates that checking the validity of documents before processing the payment is a rule established to increase efficiency and avoid unnecessary work for the airline staff.",-
Check validity of documents,Check-in luggage,-,"The text states, ""I mean, if the ticket is not valid, or the passport is not valid, we can cancel the whole process and I don’t waste my time. Also, my other colleagues are doing it like that."" This indicates that while there might not be a formal rule requiring document validation before check-in, it is a common practice followed by the staff because it's considered more efficient.",-,"While not a strict law of nature, there is a logical flow suggesting document validation should occur before luggage check-in. Invalid documents could lead to cancellation, making luggage processing unnecessary. This is a data dependency where the decision to proceed with check-in relies on the outcome of document validation."
Check validity of documents,Load luggage,-,-,-,-
Weigh baggage,Cancel check-in,-,-,-,-
Weigh baggage,Process payment,-,-,-,-
Weigh baggage,Check-in luggage,-,-,"The airline mandates that check-in should be done after other steps, including weighing, to ensure payment for overweight baggage is processed.",You cannot associate a baggage tag (during check-in) with the weight without first weighing the luggage. This is a data dependency as check-in needs the weight information.
Weigh baggage,Load luggage,-,-,-,"Loading luggage requires knowing its weight to ensure the aircraft doesn't exceed its safe takeoff weight. This is a resource dependency, as loading (consuming weight capacity) depends on the weight information from weighing."
Cancel check-in,Process payment,-,-,-,"Data Dependency: Canceling a check-in likely impacts data (e.g., baggage allowance) that processing payment might rely on, potentially leading to errors if attempted in reverse."
Cancel check-in,Check-in luggage,-,-,-,"Canceling a check-in signifies the termination of the process, as stated in the description: 'Important is that after canceling a check-in instance, you should not perform any other activities.'  Therefore, due to this logical dependency stemming from the nature of cancellation, ""Check-in luggage"" cannot occur after."
Cancel check-in,Load luggage,-,-,-,"Loading luggage implies it is approved for travel, which is reversed by canceling the check-in. This creates a logical dependency where loading luggage cannot happen before a valid check-in."
Process payment,Check-in luggage,-,-,The airline mandates that check-in should only occur after confirming payment processing. This rule is internal to the airline and can be modified at their discretion.,-
Process payment,Load luggage,-,-,"The airline mandates that check-in, including baggage tagging, should only occur after payment processing, indicating an internal rule.","There's a data dependency. The system likely uses baggage tag information to update luggage data and its impact on aircraft load. Processing payment beforehand ensures the system has all necessary information, including potential overweight charges."
Check-in luggage,Load luggage,-,-,-,Luggage needs to be checked in and processed before it can be loaded onto the aircraft. This is a resource dependency where the loading activity depends on the output of the check-in activity.
