Search for a topic,Conduct informal meeting to explain topic,-,-,-,"It is illogical and practically impossible to discuss a thesis topic in a meeting with a supervisor without first having a topic in mind. The student must first search for and identify potential topics before a meaningful discussion can occur. The supervisor's role is to guide and refine the student's initial exploration, not to dictate a topic without any prior input. This ordering is due to a **logical dependency**. The informal meeting is inherently dependent on the existence of a topic to discuss. Without the student first searching for a topic, the informal meeting lacks a subject and purpose."
Search for a topic,Write and submit proposal,-,-,-,You cannot write a proposal about a topic before having a topic selected. The topic acts as an input to the 'Write and submit proposal' activity.
Search for a topic,Get registered by chair on Koinon,-,-,"The university mandates a minimum number of ECTS before thesis registration, but the process description suggests that searching for a topic and getting informally approved by the chair precedes the formal registration on Koinon. This order appears to be a business rule specific to the department or even individual chairs, as the Student Service Center mentions that students *can* start searching for topics and talking to chairs before ECTS confirmation. Additionally, the supervisor mentions that the proposal (when required) is reviewed and approved before registration on Koinon.",-
Search for a topic,Student accept thesis on Koinon,-,-,-,"The student cannot accept a thesis on Koinon without first having a thesis topic to accept. This constitutes a data dependency, as the 'accept thesis' activity requires the data generated from the 'search for a topic' activity. The student cannot agree to work on a thesis that hasn't been defined yet."
Search for a topic,Start writing thesis,-,-,-,You cannot start writing a thesis without first identifying a topic to write about. This is a logical dependency where the output of the first activity (identified topic) is a mandatory input to the second activity (writing the thesis).
Search for a topic,Conduct regular catch-up meetings,-,-,-,"Catch-up meetings are meant to discuss progress and address challenges related to a chosen thesis topic. Without a topic, these meetings lack purpose. You cannot have a productive catch-up meeting about a thesis without first establishing what the thesis is about."
Search for a topic,Submit thesis on Koinon,-,-,-,"You cannot submit a thesis to Koinon without having a thesis topic, which is determined in the 'Search for a topic' activity. This constitutes a data dependency."
Search for a topic,Present thesis in Colloquium,"The examination regulations mandate that the colloquium happens after the thesis submission, which inherently requires a topic to be chosen beforehand.",-,-,"Logical dependency - A thesis cannot be presented before it has been written, and a thesis requires a topic."
Conduct informal meeting to explain topic,Write and submit proposal,-,The supervisor states that the informal meeting is 'not mandatory by the university' but 'necessary' for student-supervisor alignment. This suggests a common practice rather than a rule.,-,-
Conduct informal meeting to explain topic,Get registered by chair on Koinon,-,"The informal meeting, while not mandatory, is considered necessary and common practice for supervisors to ensure students understand and are invested in their chosen thesis topic. This practice facilitates a collaborative topic selection process.",-,"Data dependency: Registration on Koinon requires a defined thesis topic, which is established during the informal meeting."
Conduct informal meeting to explain topic,Student accept thesis on Koinon,-,"The informal meeting, while not mandated by the university, is a common practice to ensure mutual understanding and student commitment before formalizing the thesis topic on Koinon.",-,-
Conduct informal meeting to explain topic,Start writing thesis,-,"The supervisor states that the informal meeting is ""not mandatory by the university,"" but ""necessary"" and a common practice for supervisors to ensure students understand the topic before starting.",-,"A student cannot effectively start writing a thesis without a clear understanding of the topic, which is established in the informal meeting. This creates a logical dependency."
Conduct informal meeting to explain topic,Conduct regular catch-up meetings,-,-,-,-
Conduct informal meeting to explain topic,Submit thesis on Koinon,-,-,-,"Logical dependency: A student cannot submit a thesis on a topic without first understanding the topic, which is facilitated by the informal meeting."
Conduct informal meeting to explain topic,Present thesis in Colloquium,-,-,-,"The student cannot present a thesis in a colloquium without having a topic. The informal meeting is where the topic is discussed and agreed upon, establishing a logical dependency."
Write and submit proposal,Get registered by chair on Koinon,-,"While writing and submitting a proposal is common practice at the university, with chairs often having their own templates and requirements, it is not mandatory. The student interview reveals that some chairs do not require a proposal, indicating flexibility in the process and suggesting a departmental best practice rather than a university-wide rule.",-,-
Write and submit proposal,Student accept thesis on Koinon,-,-,"The requirement for a proposal before thesis acceptance on Koinon is not mandated by the university but rather a practice adopted by some chairs, indicating it's a rule under their jurisdiction.",-
Write and submit proposal,Start writing thesis,-,-,"The requirement for a proposal comes from the chair, not the university or government.  The student interview confirms that proposal requirements vary between chairs, indicating a chair-specific rule.","Logical dependency: A thesis proposal defines the scope and direction of the research, which is necessary before starting to write the thesis."
Write and submit proposal,Conduct regular catch-up meetings,-,-,"The decision to require a proposal and the frequency of meetings are both left to the discretion of each chair, as evidenced by the supervisor's statements and variations in student experiences.",-
Write and submit proposal,Submit thesis on Koinon,-,-,-,"The proposal contains essential information (research question, methodology, etc.) that forms the basis of the thesis.  You cannot submit a thesis without this information being defined, making it a data dependency."
Write and submit proposal,Present thesis in Colloquium,-,-,"The university's examination regulations mandate the thesis and Colloquium but not a proposal or its timing. Requiring a proposal before the Colloquium is a departmental decision, making it a business rule.",-
Get registered by chair on Koinon,Student accept thesis on Koinon,-,-,-,"The student cannot accept a thesis on Koinon that has not been created and assigned to them. The chair must first register the thesis on Koinon, creating the data entry for the thesis and linking it to the student, before the student can access and accept it. This constitutes a data dependency, where the action of accepting relies on the prior existence of the thesis registration data."
Get registered by chair on Koinon,Start writing thesis,-,-,"While the university mandates enrollment for the thesis period, it doesn't explicitly state that Koinon registration must precede writing. The Student Service Center confirms flexibility in the timing, suggesting it's an administrative process established by the university, falling under a Business Rule.",-
Get registered by chair on Koinon,Conduct regular catch-up meetings,-,-,-,"Logical dependency: Registration formalizes the thesis, creating a defined subject and context for regular supervisory meetings."
Get registered by chair on Koinon,Submit thesis on Koinon,-,-,-,The student cannot submit their thesis on Koinon without first being registered. This is a data dependency inherent in the system's functionality.
Get registered by chair on Koinon,Present thesis in Colloquium,"The university's examination regulations (APSO & FPSO) mandate that thesis registration (specifically mentioned as being done on Koinon) must occur before the colloquium, which is the formal thesis defense.",-,-,-
Student accept thesis on Koinon,Start writing thesis,-,-,-,-
Student accept thesis on Koinon,Conduct regular catch-up meetings,-,-,-,Logical dependency: Catch-up meetings about a thesis are illogical without first formally accepting the thesis topic and initiating the project.
Student accept thesis on Koinon,Submit thesis on Koinon,-,-,-,The student cannot submit the thesis on Koinon without first accepting it because the system requires formal acceptance of terms and conditions before submission. This is a logical dependency enforced by the platform's design.
Student accept thesis on Koinon,Present thesis in Colloquium,"The provided text states that ""it is mandated by the university's examination regulations that the colloquium must happen after the thesis is submitted."" This indicates a rule enforced by the university, which is a governmental institution in this case (Technical University of Munich). Therefore, the ordering of these activities is a Governmental Law.",-,-,This ordering is also due to a law of nature in the form of a logical dependency. A student cannot present a thesis in a colloquium that hasn't been submitted and reviewed yet. The content of the colloquium relies on the existence of a finalized and submitted thesis document.
Start writing thesis,Conduct regular catch-up meetings,-,-,-,-
Start writing thesis,Submit thesis on Koinon,-,-,-,You cannot submit a thesis that has not been written. This is a logical dependency where the output of the first activity (a written thesis) is a prerequisite for the second activity (submission).
Start writing thesis,Present thesis in Colloquium,-,-,-,Logical dependency: Cannot present a thesis that has not been written yet.
Conduct regular catch-up meetings,Submit thesis on Koinon,-,"The university mandates a minimum meeting time, but the frequency and structure of regular catch-up meetings are left to the supervisor and student, suggesting it's a best practice for ensuring thesis progress.",-,Logical dependency - Catch-up meetings ensure the thesis is on track and ready for submission. Submitting without them risks a poorly developed or incomplete thesis.
Conduct regular catch-up meetings,Present thesis in Colloquium,-,"While the university mandates a minimal meeting frequency (0.2 semester weekly hours), the described regular catch-up meetings, especially increasing to weekly before the colloquium, are presented as a common practice by supervisors rather than an enforced rule.",-,"Regular meetings allow the supervisor to track progress and provide feedback, which helps the student prepare a better presentation for the colloquium. The supervisor's input during these meetings can significantly impact the content and quality of the final presentation."
Submit thesis on Koinon,Present thesis in Colloquium,The university's examination regulations explicitly mandate that the colloquium (presentation) must take place after the official submission of the thesis.,-,-,There is a logical dependency. A student cannot present and defend a thesis that has not been formally submitted and reviewed. The presentation's content relies on the finalized thesis document.
