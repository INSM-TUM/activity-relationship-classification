First Activity;Second Activity;Governmental Law;Best Practice;Business Rule;Law of Nature
Scan ticket;Change number of bags;-;-;The process description states that ticket scanning is done first to retrieve passenger information, which is necessary before handling change requests such as changing the number of bags. This order is determined by the airline's system and procedures, which can be classified as a business rule.;The relationship is also due to a law of nature, specifically a data dependency. The passenger's information, obtained from scanning the ticket, is required to associate and process any changes to their booking, including the number of bags.
Scan ticket;Change seat;-;-;The process description states that after scanning the ticket, the system retrieves passenger information, which is necessary to handle change requests like seat changes. This order is determined by the organization's process flow and can be modified at their discretion.;The ticket must be scanned first to retrieve passenger information, which is required to make seat changes. This creates a data dependency.
Scan ticket;Check validity of documents;-;The process description suggests that checking the validity of documents after scanning the ticket is a common practice among staff to avoid wasting time on invalid tickets or passports. This is not enforced by law or a strict business rule, but rather a procedure accepted by the staff as an efficient way to handle the check-in process.;-;-
Scan ticket;Weigh baggage;-;While not strictly required, scanning the ticket before weighing the baggage is considered a best practice as it allows the staff to access passenger information, including the number of bags booked, which is useful for the subsequent activities. However, the process description mentions that sometimes the weight is checked first, indicating flexibility in the order.;-;-
Scan ticket;Cancel check-in;-;Scanning the ticket first allows staff to access passenger information, which is necessary to properly identify and cancel a check-in if needed. This order appears to be a standard procedure for efficiency, but not a strict rule or law.;-;-
Scan ticket;Process payment;-;-;The airline requires that the ticket be scanned before processing any payments. This allows them to access passenger information and handle change requests, which may result in additional fees. It's a rule set by the airline to ensure proper handling of passenger data and potential charges.;-
Scan ticket;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline requires scanning the ticket before check-in to access passenger information and process any changes or payments. This rule is under the airline's control and can be changed at their discretion.;The ticket must be scanned to retrieve passenger information necessary for the check-in process, creating a data dependency.
Scan ticket;Load luggage;-;-;-;The ticket must be scanned first to obtain passenger information, including the number of bags booked. This information is necessary for the luggage loading process, creating a data dependency between the two activities.
Change number of bags;Change seat;-;-;-;-
Change number of bags;Check validity of documents;-;-;-;-
Change number of bags;Weigh baggage;-;-;-;The baggage must be weighed after any changes to the number of bags to ensure accurate weight calculation for each piece of luggage and the overall aircraft load.
Change number of bags;Cancel check-in;-;-;-;The cancellation of check-in logically cannot precede any changes to the booking, as canceling the check-in would terminate the entire process, making any subsequent changes impossible or meaningless.
Change number of bags;Process payment;-;-;The airline requires payment for changes to the number of bags, which is a rule set by the business to cover additional costs and effort associated with last-minute changes.;-
Change number of bags;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline wants to ensure that all changes, including the number of bags, are processed before check-in to ensure proper payment and system updates.;-
Change number of bags;Load luggage;-;-;The airline allows changes to the number of bags before loading the luggage, likely to accommodate customer needs while ensuring proper planning and processing of luggage. This rule is under the airline's jurisdiction and can be changed at their discretion.;-
Change seat;Check validity of documents;-;-;-;-
Change seat;Weigh baggage;-;-;-;-
Change seat;Cancel check-in;-;-;-;The cancellation of check-in logically cannot precede any other activity in the process, including changing a seat, as it represents the termination of the entire check-in process.
Change seat;Process payment;-;-;The airline requires payment for last-minute changes, including seat changes, to cover additional costs and efforts. This is a rule set by the airline and can be changed at their discretion.;-
Change seat;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline wants to ensure that all changes and payments are processed before checking in the luggage. This is a rule set by the airline to manage their operations efficiently and can be changed at their discretion.;-
Change seat;Load luggage;-;-;-;These activities are not directly related in the process. Changing a seat is part of the check-in process, while loading luggage occurs after check-in is completed. There's no inherent dependency between these specific activities.
Check validity of documents;Weigh baggage;-;The process description mentions that checking the validity of documents before weighing the baggage is a practice followed by the staff ('What I usually do then is to validate the documents. I mean, if the ticket is not valid, or the passport is not valid, we can cancel the whole process and I don't waste my time.'), but it's not strictly enforced as sometimes they check the weight first.;-;-
Check validity of documents;Cancel check-in;-;The process description states 'if the ticket is not valid, or the passport is not valid, we can cancel the whole process and I don't waste my time.' This suggests that checking document validity before potentially canceling the check-in is a best practice to save time and improve efficiency.;-;-
Check validity of documents;Process payment;-;The process description suggests that checking the validity of documents before processing any payment is a common practice among the staff. This is done to avoid wasting time on further activities if the documents are not valid, as indicated by 'if the ticket is not valid, or the passport is not valid, we can cancel the whole process and I don't waste my time.';-;-
Check validity of documents;Check-in luggage;-;The process description states 'I mean, if the ticket is not valid, or the passport is not valid, we can cancel the whole process and I don't waste my time.' This indicates that checking document validity before checking in luggage is considered a more efficient way to handle the process, which aligns with the definition of a best practice.;-;-
Check validity of documents;Load luggage;-;Checking the validity of documents before loading luggage is considered a best practice to ensure that only passengers with valid documents proceed to the next steps of the check-in process. This helps in avoiding unnecessary handling of luggage for passengers who may not be allowed to travel.;-;-
Weigh baggage;Cancel check-in;-;-;-;This relationship is not due to a law of nature. Canceling a check-in can occur at any point in the process, including after weighing the baggage. There is no logical, data, or resource dependency that requires weighing to occur before cancellation.
Weigh baggage;Process payment;-;-;The airline requires weighing the baggage before processing payment to ensure that any overweight fees are calculated and charged accurately. This is a rule set by the airline that could be changed at their discretion.;-
Weigh baggage;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline wants the staff to only check in the luggage after other activities, including weighing, are completed to ensure that any necessary payments (e.g., for overweight luggage) are processed before check-in.;There is also a logical dependency, as the weight of the luggage needs to be known before it can be properly checked in and accounted for in the aircraft's load calculation.
Weigh baggage;Load luggage;-;-;-;This is a law of nature due to a data dependency. The weight of the baggage must be known before loading to ensure proper weight distribution and aircraft balance. Additionally, overweight luggage may need special handling, which is determined by weighing before loading.
Cancel check-in;Process payment;-;-;-;Once a check-in is cancelled, no further activities related to that check-in process should be performed, including payment processing. This is a logical dependency where cancellation precludes any subsequent actions.
Cancel check-in;Check-in luggage;-;The process description states 'Important is that after canceling a checkin instance, you should not perform any other activities.' This suggests it's a recommended practice to stop the process after cancellation, rather than a strict rule or law.;-;The check-in process cannot logically continue after it has been canceled, as cancellation terminates the entire process.
Cancel check-in;Load luggage;-;-;-;Once a check-in is canceled, no further activities related to that check-in instance should be performed, including loading luggage. This is a logical dependency as loading luggage for a canceled check-in would be nonsensical and potentially cause errors in the system.
Process payment;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline wants the check-in to be done only after other things, including payment processing, are completed. This is likely to ensure that all fees are collected before the luggage is officially checked in.;-
Process payment;Load luggage;-;-;The airline wants to ensure that payment is processed before luggage is checked in and loaded, to avoid potential financial losses.;-
Check-in luggage;Load luggage;-;-;-;The luggage cannot be loaded onto the aircraft before it is checked in. This is a logical dependency as the check-in process generates the necessary information (such as weight and destination) and tags the luggage, which are required for the loading process.
