First Activity;Second Activity;Governmental Law;Best Practice;Business Rule;Law of Nature
Scan ticket;Change number of bags;-;The process description states: 'Once we have the passenger information we can then handle change requests as we need some form of information to associate the changes.' This indicates that scanning the ticket before changing the number of bags is a standard procedure considered superior to alternatives.;-;There is a data dependency. The process cannot change the number of bags without first knowing the current number, which is obtained by scanning the ticket. It's logically impossible to change something without first knowing its current state.
Scan ticket;Change seat;-;-;-;This is a data dependency. The seat change activity requires passenger information obtained from scanning the ticket. Without scanning the ticket first, there would be no way to accurately record or implement the seat change in the airline's system.
Scan ticket;Check validity of documents;-;The agent states, 'What I usually do then is to validate the documents.' This indicates a typical procedure followed to improve efficiency, not a mandated rule or law.;-;-
Scan ticket;Weigh baggage;-;The process description implies scanning the ticket first is more common and efficient, suggesting it's a procedure accepted by staff as superior, though not strictly enforced. It's not a governmental law or business rule as there's flexibility in the sequence.;-;-
Scan ticket;Cancel check-in;-;-;-;This is a logical dependency. You cannot cancel a check-in process that hasn't been initiated yet, and the check-in process begins with scanning the ticket. The ticket must be scanned first to initiate the check-in process, and only after scanning can the validity of the ticket be determined. If the ticket is invalid, only then can the check-in process be cancelled.
Scan ticket;Process payment;-;-;The airline has established a rule that payments should be processed before the check-in is completed, as stated: 'The airline wants us to only do the check-in if the other things are done to make sure that the payment is processed.' This is under the airline's jurisdiction and can be changed at their discretion.;-
Scan ticket;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline explicitly requires check-in to be done after other activities, including scanning the ticket, to ensure payment processing. This rule is under the airline's jurisdiction and can be changed at their discretion.;There's a data dependency where information from the scanned ticket (e.g., number of bags booked) is necessary to properly check in the luggage.
Scan ticket;Load luggage;-;-;The airline has established a specific order of operations to ensure all necessary steps are completed before luggage moves forward in the process. This rule is under the airline's jurisdiction and can be changed at their discretion.;There's a logical dependency as scanning the ticket retrieves necessary passenger information for proper luggage handling and tracking during loading.
Change number of bags;Change seat;-;-;-;-
Change number of bags;Check validity of documents;-;The agent states 'What I usually do then is to validate the documents.' This suggests checking document validity after handling change requests is a common practice among staff to save time and effort, but not a mandated rule.;-;-
Change number of bags;Weigh baggage;-;It's logical and efficient to finalize the number of bags before weighing them. This approach allows for accurate weight measurement of all the luggage the passenger intends to check in. It's a procedure that would be widely accepted in the airline industry as a superior way to handle luggage check-in.;-;-
Change number of bags;Cancel check-in;-;-;The process description states that after canceling a check-in, no other activities should be performed. This implies that changing the number of bags must occur before cancellation, which is a rule established by the airline or check-in system to ensure proper process flow and data integrity.;-
Change number of bags;Process payment;-;-;The airline has established a policy requiring payment for changes in the number of bags, as stated: 'We offer our customers last-minute changes. We then request an additional fee. This is not only to make some more profit but also covers the additional cost of changing the already planned aircraft and its load. It is an additional effort for the airline. Thus, passengers have to pay.';-
Change number of bags;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline requires all changes and payments to be completed before check-in, as stated: 'The airline wants us to only do the check-in if the other things are done to make sure that the payment is processed.';-
Change number of bags;Load luggage;-;-;This order is likely determined by the airline to ensure all administrative tasks and changes are completed before physical handling of luggage begins, allowing for proper planning and weight distribution. It's under the airline's jurisdiction and can be changed at their discretion.;-
Change seat;Check validity of documents;-;-;-;-
Change seat;Weigh baggage;-;-;-;-
Change seat;Cancel check-in;-;-;-;-
Change seat;Process payment;-;-;The airline has set a rule that all changes, including seat changes, must be processed before payment to ensure proper check-in. This rule is under the airline's jurisdiction and can be changed at their discretion.;-
Change seat;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline wants all changes, including seat changes, to be completed before luggage check-in to ensure payment processing. This is a rule set by the airline that can be changed at their discretion.;-
Change seat;Load luggage;-;-;The airline has designed their process to complete all passenger-related activities, including seat changes, before luggage handling. This ordering is a decision made by the airline to streamline their process and can be changed at their discretion.;-
Check validity of documents;Weigh baggage;-;The agent states that validating documents before proceeding with other activities is their usual practice to avoid wasting time if documents are invalid. This indicates it's an accepted procedure among staff for efficiency, rather than a mandated rule or law.;-;-
Check validity of documents;Cancel check-in;-;The process description states that staff usually validate documents before canceling to save time, indicating it's a common procedure for efficiency rather than a strict rule or law.;-;Logical dependency: The information from checking documents is necessary to make the decision to cancel check-in, creating a logical sequence that cannot be reversed.
Check validity of documents;Process payment;-;The agent states they validate documents before proceeding to avoid wasting time on invalid cases, indicating an accepted efficient procedure among staff.;-;-
Check validity of documents;Check-in luggage;-;The agent states 'What I usually do then is to validate the documents. I mean, if the ticket is not valid, or the passport is not valid, we can cancel the whole process and I don't waste my time.' This indicates a procedure accepted by staff as more efficient, making it a best practice rather than a strict rule or law.;-;-
Check validity of documents;Load luggage;-;-;The airline has implemented this step to ensure efficiency and prevent unnecessary work. It's under their full jurisdiction and can be changed at their discretion.;There's a logical dependency as luggage can't be loaded until it's confirmed the passenger is allowed to travel, which is determined by checking their documents.
Weigh baggage;Cancel check-in;-;-;-;This is a logical dependency. Cancelling the check-in can only occur after the check-in process has begun, which includes weighing the baggage. You cannot cancel a process that hasn't started yet.
Weigh baggage;Process payment;-;-;The airline requires weighing before payment to determine if extra fees are needed for overweight luggage. This is a policy set by the airline that can be changed at their discretion.;-
Weigh baggage;Check-in luggage;The process description states that the law protects workers handling luggage, requiring weighing to ensure it's not over 23 kg. This is reinforced by the additional information that checked-in luggage must be weighed in all cases for safe manual handling limits.;-;-;There's a data dependency as the weight information is necessary for determining overweight status, special handling needs, and contributing to the aircraft's overall weight calculation before check-in can be completed.
Weigh baggage;Load luggage;The process description states that the law protects workers loading heavy luggage, indicating a legal requirement to weigh baggage before loading to ensure it's not over 23 kg. This is a matter of occupational health and safety, typically regulated by governmental bodies.;-;-;There is a data dependency as the weight of the luggage needs to be known before determining whether it can be loaded normally or needs special handling. This information is crucial for the loading process and aircraft weight calculations.
Cancel check-in;Process payment;-;-;The process description states 'after canceling a checkin instance, you should not perform any other activities.' This rule is set by the airline or check-in system, falling under the stakeholders' jurisdiction.;Once a check-in is canceled, processing payment for a non-provided service would create logical inconsistencies and potential legal issues.
Cancel check-in;Check-in luggage;-;-;The process description states, 'Important is that after canceling a checkin instance, you should not perform any other activities.' This indicates a rule established by the airline that can be changed at their discretion.;It's logically impossible to check in luggage for a check-in that has been canceled, creating a logical dependency between these activities.
Cancel check-in;Load luggage;-;-;-;This relationship is governed by logical dependency. If a check-in is cancelled, the luggage associated with that check-in cannot be loaded onto the aircraft. The cancellation terminates the entire process for that passenger, making it impossible for any subsequent activities, including loading luggage, to occur.
Process payment;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline explicitly requires payment processing before check-in, as stated: 'The airline wants us to only do the check-in if the other things are done to make sure that the payment is processed.' This is a rule set by the airline, which they can change at their discretion.;-
Process payment;Load luggage;-;-;The airline requires payment to be processed before check-in and loading luggage, as stated: 'The airline wants us to only do the check-in if the other things are done to make sure that the payment is processed.' This is a rule under the airline's jurisdiction.;-
Check-in luggage;Load luggage;-;-;The airline explicitly requires check-in to be done before loading to ensure payment processing, which is a rule under their jurisdiction.;The luggage must be checked in (tagged and entered into the system) before it can be identified and properly loaded onto the correct aircraft, creating a logical dependency.
