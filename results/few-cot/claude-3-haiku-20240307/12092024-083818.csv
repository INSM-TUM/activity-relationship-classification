Scan ticket;Change number of bags;-;The process description indicates that scanning the ticket first is the standard industry procedure to gather the necessary passenger information before handling change requests. This is not mandated by law nor a rigid business rule, but rather a generally accepted best practice.;-;There is a data dependency between scanning the ticket and changing the number of bags, as the latter requires the information obtained from the former. However, this data dependency does not make the ordering an absolute, inviolable law of nature.
Scan ticket;Change seat;-;The process description indicates that scanning the ticket first to obtain the passenger information is an accepted and standard practice, even though it is not strictly required. This suggests it is a best practice rather than a governmental law or business rule.;-;-

Scan ticket;Cancel check-in;-;-;The process description indicates that the order of Scan Ticket before Cancel Check-in is a rule set by the airline/organization, and not mandated by any governmental law or industry-wide best practice.

Change seat;Check validity of documents;-;The process description indicates that changing the seat is a standard procedure that is accepted by the organization's staff and industry-wide, and checking the validity of documents is then performed after the seat has been changed, likely as a best practice to ensure the passenger's information is up-to-date and valid before proceeding.;-;-

The luggage needs to be physically present and processed through the Check-in before it can be loaded onto the aircraft. This is a logical and resource dependency, as the luggage cannot be loaded without first being checked in.
