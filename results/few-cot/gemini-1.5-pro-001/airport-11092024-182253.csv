Scan ticket;Change number of bags;-;-;-;Data Dependency: You cannot change the number of bags before retrieving the original number of bags from scanning the ticket.
Scan ticket;Change seat;-;-;-;-
Scan ticket;Check validity of documents;-;The agent's statement suggests that checking the ticket first is a common practice for efficiency, likely accepted by staff, but not a strict rule.;-;-
Scan ticket;Weigh baggage;-;The agent usually scans the ticket before weighing the baggage because it is more efficient, although passengers often put their luggage on the scale first. This implies a practice based on experience for a smoother process, not a strict rule.;-;-
Scan ticket;Cancel check-in;-;-;-;Data Dependency: Ticket information obtained from scanning is necessary to determine if the check-in should be canceled.
Scan ticket;Process payment;-;-;The airline has made it a rule in their process to ensure payment is processed before luggage is checked in and tagged. This rule is specific to their operations and could be modified.;-
Scan ticket;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline has a specific rule that requires several steps, including payment, to be completed before luggage check-in. This rule is within the airline's control to change.;-
Scan ticket;Load luggage;-;-;-;The luggage cannot be loaded onto the aircraft until it has been checked in and associated with a passenger and flight. This association happens when the ticket is scanned, creating a logical dependency.

Change number of bags;Process payment;-;-;The airline mandates that changes to the number of bags must be reflected in the payment amount, making this ordering a rule under the airline's control.;-
Change number of bags;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline has set a rule that all changes to passenger information, including the number of bags, must be completed before the luggage can be checked in. This ensures payment processing and avoids complications later in the process.;-
Change number of bags;Load luggage;-;-;-;You cannot load luggage onto a plane that hasn't been properly accounted for. Changing the number of bags is part of finalizing the passenger's manifest.  Logically, the system needs to recognize the correct number of bags a passenger has *before* those bags are physically loaded onto the aircraft.

Check validity of documents;Weigh baggage;-;The agent states that they usually validate documents before weighing baggage to avoid wasting time if the documents are invalid, indicating a preference for efficiency rather than a strict rule.;-;-
Check validity of documents;Cancel check-in;-;-;-;Data Dependency: Cannot determine whether to cancel without first knowing if documents are valid.
Check validity of documents;Process payment;-;The agent prioritizes checking document validity to potentially avoid unnecessary payment processing if documents are invalid, indicating a common practice for efficiency. This is supported by the statement that colleagues follow the same procedure.;-;-
Check validity of documents;Check-in luggage;-;The agent and their colleagues prioritize checking documents early to avoid wasting time on invalid bookings, indicating an established efficient practice.;-;-
Check validity of documents;Load luggage;-;The agent and their colleagues have adopted this order to avoid unnecessary work if documents are invalid, highlighting it as an efficient practice within the team, even if not explicitly mandated by the airline.;-;-
Weigh baggage;Cancel check-in;-;-;-;-
Weigh baggage;Process payment;-;-;The airline requires payment for overweight baggage, making it a rule internal to their operations.;-
Weigh baggage;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline explicitly wants the weight checked before the luggage is checked in to ensure payment for overweight baggage is processed. This is stated in the text:  'The airline wants us to only do the check-in if the other things are done to make sure that the payment is processed.' This demonstrates a rule imposed by the airline for their operational flow.;You cannot complete the check-in process for luggage without knowing the weight. The weight is printed on the baggage tag, which is a necessary component of the check-in process. This creates a resource dependency where the check-in luggage activity relies on the output of the weigh baggage activity.
Weigh baggage;Load luggage;-;-;-;The luggage needs to be physically available to be loaded, creating a resource dependency.
Cancel check-in;Process payment;-;-;-;Logical dependency: The process dictates that no further actions, including payment, occur after check-in cancellation.
Cancel check-in;Check-in luggage;-;-;-;Logical dependency: You cannot check-in luggage if the check-in instance has been canceled.
Cancel check-in;Load luggage;-;-;-;Canceling a check-in logically means the luggage is no longer authorized for the flight, creating a dependency where loading luggage cannot happen before a potential cancellation.
Process payment;Check-in luggage;-;-;The airline explicitly requires payment processing before the check-in can be completed, as stated in the text: 'The airline wants us to only do the check-in if the other things are done to make sure that the payment is processed.';-
Process payment;Load luggage;-;-;The airline mandates that check-in, which includes payment processing, must occur before luggage loading. This rule ensures revenue security and is a business decision under the airline's control.;-
Check-in luggage;Load luggage;-;-;The airline explicitly requires check-in to be completed before loading luggage: 'The airline wants us to only do the check-in if the other things are done...' ;The luggage needs to be checked-in and therefore physically present at the aircraft to be loaded, creating a resource dependency.
