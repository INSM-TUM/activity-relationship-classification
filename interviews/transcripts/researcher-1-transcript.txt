[Interviewer] Hi, could you please walk me through the overall process of thesis registration and submission at your university?

[Speaker] Yeah, well, practically there's two options. Each chair has published the thesis topics in the website. Otherwise, the students have an idea. For example, in the first scenario, when a topic is already published in the website, the students read this topic, the outcome of this topic. And if the student likes this topic, they will approach the chair. It could be directly to the professor or to the PhD students or postdocs for this. So there is an informal discussion by maybe an appointment, so to explain in detail the thesis topic to the student and see if the student likes this topic and the possible outcomes. In that case, the student starts to write the proposal if the chair requires it. The proposal is first reviewed by the advisor. And the advisor is, you know, the scientific person in the chair, which could be a PhD or a postdoc. If the proposal is good, this proposal is sent to the professor or the main person in the chair, and this person will be the examiner of the thesis. The examiner of the thesis is the person who puts the grade at the end. When the examiner approves this proposal, the proposal is saved for the chair locally somewhere. And the advisor uses the online platform Koinon, I think is the name. Then what the advisor does is practically register this new thesis on the platform. Practically, you submit the title, the information of the student, the information of the advisors, the examiner, and the date of starting the thesis. I think you can start any date. Then the student gets an email and the student approves the thesis. Then, the student service center also get an email where they check the ECTS. If the student has the minimum number of ECTS already passed, then they approve that the student can start the thesis. In this case, the student starts the thesis, starts to implement or develop or something. It is supposed that the student has a weekly meeting, at least weekly meeting with the advisor to check the development, implementation, and so on. And then, the advisor is who recommends if the thesis is finished or not, and also recommends the student to start writing or not. But the thesis has a duration of four months. The advisor is responsible for managing the presentation of the thesis, which is apart from the already fixed submission date, because the submission is one thing, and the presentation is another. And yeah, when the student is about to submit the thesis, the advisor has to manage this date for the presentation. That could be a couple of weeks after the submission, for example, or a couple of days after. Okay. When the thesis is submitted, the advisor suggests a grade to the examiner. There is a discussion between the examiner and the advisor or supervisor. And they define the grade of the thesis. And then the presentation is evaluated, of course, by the examiner and the advisor. Again, they discuss the presentation. The presentation is open, so anyone can attend on site and ask questions and so on. The time for that is around 30 minutes in total, 20 minutes for the presentation and 10 minutes for questions and answers. And then we have to submit the grade of the presentation also.

[Interviewer] Okay. Perfect. Then I'm just going to ask you a few questions about individual phases. So, for example, in the topic selection, you said it's either that the student has an idea or that they check the website. And then they have an informal discussion with the supervisor to explain the topic to the student. Correct? And then they do the proposal. 

[Speaker] Yes. 

[Interviewer] So, is the informal discussion mandatory? Or is it just what you do at your chair or what the supervisors usually do? 

[Speaker] I think it's not mandatory by the university, but it's necessary and what the supervisors usually do. Because the student has to be convinced about the topic. Okay. And the supervisor has to figure out if the student likes the topic and if the student understands the outcome of the topic. So, it's not mandatory, but it's necessary.

[Interviewer] Yeah. And the proposal, is it also, do all the other chairs do a proposal? Or is it up to the chair to decide if they need a proposal or not? 

[Speaker] It is up to each chair to decide if they require a propsal or not. Each chair has a different template or different requirements for a proposal. Some chairs include background, others call it context or related work. Okay. But the typical thing is that a proposal has a motivation, background, maybe explain a little bit the methodology, the expected results, and, of course, the references. I think that's the minimum thing that a proposal has. So it depends on the chairs. 

[Interviewer] Okay, perfect. So let's say now that the student and the supervisor both agree, they either write a proposal if it's required or they do not if it's not required, and now the advisor uses Koinon to register the thesis. 

[Speaker] Yes. 

[Interviewer] So it's not possible to register the thesis before checking the credits, correct? If they do not meet the minimum requirement, then they cannot register the thesis online. 

[Speaker] Yeah, this is true, the student needs to have a minimum amount of ECTS before registering the thesis, 150 I think, which would be check by the Student Service Center

[Interviewer] Okay. And is it possible to theoretically, let's say the student is facing some delays in their registration, could they start working on their thesis before being registered? And then later after being registered, just use whatever they wrote as a starting point or is that not allowed? 

[Speaker] So the thing is, the thesis is supposed to be four months, but of course the student can begin working before being registered, but it is not how it is supposed to happen. Usually the proposal should be very realistic in terms of being able to finish the thesis in four months. So the student doesn't have to study in advance. But there isn't anything that strictly forbids the student from starting in advance.

[Interviewer] So once the student starts writing the thesis, then you have the weekly meetings. Is that mandatory by the university or is it just what your chair does? 

[Speaker] The university mandates 0.2 semester weekly hours for the bachelor thesis which represents maybe 10 minutes or so per week. I don't know. Yeah. So it's mandatory to have these ten minutes, but it's not realistic because a bachelor thesis student didn't write a thesis before, so they are learning, they have several mistakes and so on. So what the supervisors usually do is to have the longer weekly meetings with the bachelor students. 

[Interviewer] Okay. And has your department maybe or chair regulated any other specific procedures for this phase or is it only the weekly meetings? 

[Speaker] We didn't establish any rules, honestly, as a chair. Yeah. That depends how you, how each scientific person or PhD student or postdoc organizes it with the student. 

[Interviewer] Okay, perfect. And once the student finishes their writing phase, what is the procedure exactly for submitting the completed thesis? 

[Speaker] Practically, the student is who submits the thesis. Uploads the document in Koinon. And after it's submitted, then the supervisor and examiner discuss the grade.

[Interviewer] And before the student submits, does the supervisor need to approve that the student is allowed to submit it? 

[Speaker] Okay, but it's not like absolutely necessary as in that they cannot submit it on the portal without the supervisor approving it, it doesn't say, like, I have to click something before or nothing. But the best practice is to review the document with the advisor before, otherwise, the grade will be bad.

[Interviewer] And to set the grade, is there any reason you have to discuss is with the examiner? Is it mandatory by the university that the examiner has to give the grade? 

[Speaker] It's mandatory by the university that the examiner has to be a professor. And that's why I cannot provide a grade without talking with the examiner, because they are who puts the grade. They have to agree with my suggestion. The examiner is the only one available or the only one allowed to publish the grade. 

[Interviewer] Perfect. And so once the student submits the thesis, you have the colloquium, but it's mandatory to have the colloquium after the submission, correct? 

[Speaker] Yes, it is mandated by the university's examination regulations that the colloquium must happen after the thesis is submitted.
