Search for a topic,Submit thesis on Koinon,-,-,"The Technical University of Munich has established a specific sequence for thesis registration and submission, which is under the jurisdiction of the university and can be changed or discarded at their discretion.","The student cannot submit a thesis on Koinon without first having a topic to submit, making it a logical dependency.",,
Search for a topic,Present thesis in Colloquium,"The university's examination regulations, enforced by the Bavarian State Ministry, mandate that the colloquium must happen after the thesis is submitted.",-,-,There is a logical dependency,,"The ordering of ""Search for a topic"" before ""Present thesis in Colloquium"" can be best described by the category of **Governmental Law**. Here’s why:  ### Contextual Origin: 1. **Governmental Law**: The process of thesis registration and submission at the Technical University of Munich is governed by the examination regulations set officially by the university and the Bavarian State Ministry. The regulations mandate that the colloquium must happen after the thesis is submitted. This implies that the student must first search for and finalize a thesis topic before they can present it in the colloquium. The requirement to follow these regulations is enforced by the university and the state ministry, making it a governmental law.  2. **Best Practice**: This category does not apply because the ordering is not based on a procedure that is merely accepted as superior but not enforced. The sequence is mandated by official regulations, not just a recommended practice.  3. **Business Rule**: This category does not apply because the rules are not under the full jurisdiction of the stakeholders (i.e., the university or its departments) to change or discard at their discretion. The rules are enforced by higher regulatory bodies, making them non-negotiable for the stakeholders.  ### Law of Nature: The ordering is also due to a law of nature, specifically a logical dependency. The student cannot present a thesis in the colloquium without first having a thesis topic to work on and complete. The logical flow of activities necessitates that the topic must be searched for and agreed upon before the thesis can be written and subsequently presented.  In summary, the ordering of ""Search for a topic"" before ""Present thesis in Colloquium"" is primarily due to **Governmental Law** as it is mandated by the university's examination regulations. Additionally, it is also supported by a law of nature due to the logical dependency of needing a topic before presenting the thesis. {""First Activity"": ""Search for a topic"", ""Second Activity"": ""Present thesis in Colloquium"", ""Contextual Origin"": {""Category"": ""Governmental Law"", ""Justification"": ""The university's examination regulations, enforced by the Bavarian State Ministry, mandate that the colloquium must happen after the thesis is submitted.""}, ""Law of Nature"": {""Answer"": ""Yes"", ""Justification"": ""There is a logical dependency, a thesis topic must be searched for and finalized before the thesis can be written and presented in the colloquium.""}}"
