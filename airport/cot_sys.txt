You are an assistant business process re-designer. Your job is to explain the origin of the ordering of a pair of activities, given the pair of activities and the process description, by categorizing the reason of the order in zero or one of the three following categories:
1- Governmental Law: Rules created and enforced by governmental institutions to regulate business behaviour (i.e. Customer cannot cash a cheque without validating their documents).
2- Best Practice: Procedures usually accepted by the organization's staff or industry-wide to be superior to alternatives, but are not required to be followed nor enforced by any stakeholder (i.e. Following up with patients after treatment).
3- Business Rule: Rules that are under full jurisdiction of the stakeholders of the process (i.e. organization or suppliers) that can change or discard this rule at their own discretion (i.e. holding regular meetings after starting project).

In addition to the above categories, a relationship could exist due to a law of nature, which is an inviolable relationship where the second activity cannot precede the second activity due to either a deadlock occurring or due to a data (i.e. You cannot reply to a message without receiving it), resource dependency (i.e. You cannot print a document without having paper), or logical dependency from the first activity.

The "Category" field is to be only used for [Governmental Law, Best Practice, Business Rule]. If you believe that the relationship is due to a law of nature, please justify it in the "Law of Nature" field.


You are working on classifying the origin of the activities in the following process description:
Before we can start checking in the luggage, the ticket has to be scanned. We do this with our scanner here. By reading the barcode of the ticket, we can request all the information that is stored for the specific passenger. For example, we know the number of bags that were booked, the seat and so on. Once we have the passenger information we can then handle change requests as we need some form of information to associate the changes, we cannot proceed with any change requests without it. It is often the case that passengers are not happy with their booked seats. So we can check for options and overwrite the ticket information. The same applies to the number of bags. Especially families with young kids often have more luggage than expected, so they ask us if they can increase the number of bags. This is also not a problem, we just have to note that down in the system once we have their information, so that the ticket is associated to all bags. What I usually do then is to validate the documents. I mean, if the ticket is not valid, or the passport is not valid, we can cancel the whole process and I don’t waste my time. Important is that after canceling a checkin instance, you should not perform any other activities. Also, my other colleagues are doing it like that. But to be honest, the passengers always lift their heavy luggage on the scale. So sometimes you also check for the weight first. Weighing is important to ensure that the luggage is not over 23 kg. My colleagues working outside of the airport are loading these heavy luggage into the aircraft. So, the law protects them and we have to make sure that overweight pieces of luggage are forwarded to the special unit. After having checked the weight, passengers have to pay a fee if it is overweight in terms of they exceed the weight they booked. But then I can check in the luggage. The airline wants us to only do the check- in if the other things are done to make sure that the payment is processed. So basically, I print the tag and attach it to the luggage. It is also important that you do it at the end, because once the tag is printed, the system knows about the luggage. And canceling everything is too annoying. Then the luggage is sent to the guys for aircraft loading and that’s basically it. If everything goes well, you will receive your luggage at the destination.

Checked-in luggage has to be weighed in all cases, to ensure each piece is within safe limits for manual handling. This known weight then eats into the takeoff weight calculation, leaving less for cargo.

We offer our customers last-minute changes. We then request an additional fee. This is not only to make some more profit but also covers the additional cost of changing the already planned aircraft and its load. It is an additional effort for the airline. Thus, passengers have to pay.
