You are an assistant business process re-designer. Your job is to explain the origin of the ordering of a pair of activities, given the pair of activities and the process description, by categorizing the reason of the order in zero or one of the three following categories:
1- Governmental Law: Rules created and enforced by governmental institutions to regulate business behaviour (i.e. Customer cannot cash a cheque without validating their documents).
2- Best Practice: Procedures usually accepted by the organization's staff or industry-wide to be superior to alternatives, but are not required to be followed nor enforced by any stakeholder (i.e. Following up with patients after treatment).
3- Business Rule: Rules that are under full jurisdiction of the stakeholders of the process (i.e. organization or suppliers) that can change or discard this rule at their own discretion (i.e. holding regular meetings after starting project).

In addition to the above categories, a relationship could exist due to a law of nature, which is an inviolable relationship where the second activity cannot precede the second activity due to either a deadlock occurring or due to a data (i.e. You cannot reply to a message without receiving it), resource dependency (i.e. You cannot print a document without having paper), or logical dependency from the first activity.

The "Category" field is to be only used for [Governmental Law, Best Practice, Business Rule]. If you believe that the relationship is due to a law of nature, please justify it in the "Law of Nature" field.


You are working on classifying the origin of the activities in the following process description:
Before we can start checking in the luggage, the ticket has to be scanned. We do this with our scanner here. By reading the barcode of the ticket, we can request all the information that is stored for the specific passenger. For example, we know the number of bags that were booked, the seat and so on. Once we have the passenger information we can then handle change requests as we need some form of information to associate the changes. It is often the case that passengers are not happy with their booked seats. So we can check for options and overwrite the ticket information. The same applies to the number of bags. Especially families with young kids often have more luggage than expected, so they ask us if they can increase the number of bags. This is also not a problem, we just have to note that down in the system once we have their information, so that the ticket is associated to all bags. What I usually do then is to validate the documents. I mean, if the ticket is not valid, or the passport is not valid, we can cancel the whole process and I don’t waste my time. Important is that after canceling a checkin instance, you should not perform any other activities. Also, my other colleagues are doing it like that. But to be honest, the passengers always lift their heavy luggage on the scale. So sometimes you also check for the weight first. Weighing is important to ensure that the luggage is not over 23 kg. My colleagues working outside of the airport are loading these heavy luggage into the aircraft. So, the law protects them and we have to make sure that overweight pieces of luggage are forwarded to the special unit. After having checked the weight, passengers have to pay a fee if it is overweight in terms of they exceed the weight they booked. But then I can check in the luggage. The airline wants us to only do the check- in if the other things are done to make sure that the payment is processed. So basically, I print the tag and attach it to the luggage. It is also important that you do it at the end, because once the tag is printed, the system knows about the luggage. And canceling everything is too annoying. Then the luggage is sent to the guys for aircraft loading and that’s basically it. If everything goes well, you will receive your luggage at the destination.

Additional information:
Checked-in luggage has to be weighed in all cases, to ensure each piece is within safe limits for manual handling. This known weight then eats into the takeoff weight calculation, leaving less for cargo.

We offer our customers last-minute changes. We then request an additional fee. This is not only to make some more profit but also covers the additional cost of changing the already planned aircraft and its load. It is an additional effort for the airline. Thus, passengers have to pay.

Examples:
What is the relationship between Scan Ticket and Change Number of Bags?
As indicated in the process description, the number of bags can only be changed if the previous number of bags is known, this can be understood from "Once we have the passenger information we can then handle change requests as we need some form of information to associate the changes". This is a data dependency, which is a law of nature. As for the contextual origin of the process, this would best be categorized as a best practice, as it is the standard procedure in the industry to ask for the passenger information before changing handling any changes. It is not a governmental law, as it is not enforced by any institution, nor is it a business rule, as it is not under the full jurisdiction of the stakeholders.

What is the relationship between Scan Ticket and Weigh Luggage?
The agent says that sometimes they check the weight first, but it is more efficient to check the ticket first, indicating that this is simply what the airline's employees do. This is a best practice, as it is more efficient to check the ticket first. It is not a governmental law, as it is not mandated to be followed by any governmental laws, nor is it a business rule, as it is not a rule that was created by any of the stakeholders. On the other side, this ordering is not due to a law of nature, as you can theoretically weigh the luggage before scanning the ticket, it would just have negative consequences n the flow of the process.

What is the relationship between Change number of bags and Change Seat?
There is no direct relationship between changing the number of bags and changing the seat. This is not a law of nature, as there is no logical or resource dependency between the two activities, they can be easily interchanged. This is not a governmental law, as it is not enforced by any governmental institution. This is not a best practice, as the agent does not specify that it is a procedure that is accepted by the organization's staff or industry-wide to be superior to alternatives. This is not a business rule, as the business did not specify it has to be done exactly this way, rather it is just the way the process is structured.

What is the relationship between Check-in luggage and Load luggage?
The agent says that the luggage is sent to the guys for aircraft loading after the check-in is done. This is a business rule, as the airline wants the check-in to be done before the luggage is loaded. This is not a governmental law, as it is not enforced by any governmental institution. This is not a best practice, as the agent does not specify that it is a procedure that is accepted by the organization's staff or industry-wide to be superior to alternatives. This is also an example of a law of nature, as the luggage needs to be physically next to the aircraft to load it, and it cannot be loaded before the check-in is done.
