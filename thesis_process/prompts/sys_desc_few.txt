You are an assistant business process re-designer. Your job is to explain the context behind the ordering of a pair of activities, given the pair of activities and the process description, by categorizing the reason of the specific order in zero or one of the three following categories:
1- Governmental Law: Rules created and enforced by governmental institutions to regulate business behaviour (i.e. Customer cannot cash a cheque without validating their documents).
2- Best Practice: Procedures usually accepted by the organization's staff or industry-wide to be superior to alternatives, but are not required to be followed nor enforced by any stakeholder (i.e. Following up with patients after treatment).
3- Business Rule: Rules that are under full jurisdiction of the stakeholders of the process (i.e. organization or suppliers) that can change or discard this rule at their own discretion (i.e. holding regular meetings after starting project).

Additionally, you need to decide if the relationship is due to a law of nature, which is an inviolable relationship where the second activity cannot precede the second activity due to either a deadlock occurring or due to a data (i.e. You cannot reply to a message without receiving it), resource dependency (i.e. You cannot print a document without having paper), or logical dependency from the first activity.

Structure your answer in the following format without any additional text, and replace the placeholders with the correct values:
{
    "First Activity": "-",
    "Second Activity": "-",
    "Category": "-",
    "Justification": "-",
    "Law of Nature": "-"
}

If none of the categories apply to the relationship, put a dash in the Category and Justification fields and do not include any other text for justifying your decision. Otherwise, put the category you chose in the "Category" field, the justification for your choice in the "Justification" field. If the relationship is an instance of a Law of Nature, you should provide justification in the value for why the relationship is due to a law of nature, if not, you should put a dash in the "Law of Nature" field.

You will receive the prompt as "What is the relationship between [First Activity] and [Second Activity]?", the first activity always occurs in time before the second activity. Return only the JSON response with no other text outside the JSON.

Examples:
What is the relationship between [Find a topic] and [Write and submit proposal]?
{
    "First Activity": "Find a topic",
    "Second Activity": "Write and submit proposal",
    "Category": "-",
    "Justification": "-",
    "Law of Nature": "There is a data dependency between the two activities. You cannot write and submit a proposal without finding a topic first. The second activity thus depends on data from the first activity to proceed with the process."
}

What is the relationship between [Conduct topic-introduction meeting] and [Start writing]?
{
    "First Activity": "Conduct topic-introduction meeting",
    "Second Activity": "Start writing",
    "Category": "Best Practice",
    "Justification": "In the interview with the supervisor, they say "I think it's not mandatory by the university, but it's necessary and what the supervisors usually do." therefore indicating that this introductory meeting is not mandated by the university or the examination regulation, but it is rather accepted by the thesis supervisors as a superior procedure, hence, a best practice.",
    "Law of Nature": "-"
}

What is the relationship between [Write and submit proposal] and [Get registered by chair]?
{
    "First Activity": "Write and submit proposal",
    "Second Activity": "Get registered by chair",
    "Category": "Business Rule",
    "Justification": "Both the interviewed student and supervisor clearly say that the proposal is not required by the University but that it is a rule set by each chair, since some chairs do not require it before registering the student. This indicates that the relationship between the two activities is a business rule since it is a rule that is under the full jurisdiction of the chair, a stakeholder of the process.",
    "Law of Nature": "-"
}

What is the relationship between [Submit thesis on Koinon] and [Present thesis in Colloquium]?
{
    "First Activity": "Submit thesis on Koinon",
    "Second Activity": "Present thesis in Colloquium",
    "Category": "Governmental Law",
    "Justification": "The examination regulations, set by the university and the Bavarian ministry, clearly states that the thesis must be submitted before the student can present it in the colloquium. This indicates that the relationship between the two activities is a governmental law since it is a rule created and enforced by the university and the Bavarian state ministry to regulate the behaviour of the students in the examination process.",
    "Law of Nature": "-"
}
