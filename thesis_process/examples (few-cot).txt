Examples:
What is the relationship between [Find a topic] and [Write and submit proposal]?
The relationship between "Find a topic" and "Write and submit proposal" does not fit into the categories of Governmental Law, Best Practice, or Business Rule as it is not mandated or enforced by a governmental institution, and are not entirely under the jurisdiction of the stakeholders. Instead, it is an instance of a law of nature. There is a data dependency between the two activities, meaning you cannot write and submit a proposal without first finding a topic. The second activity depends on data from the first activity to proceed with the process.

What is the relationship between [Conduct topic-introduction meeting] and [Start writing]?
The relationship between "Conduct topic-introduction meeting" and "Start writing" is best categorized as a Best Practice. This classification is based on the interview with the supervisor, who mentioned that while the introductory meeting is not mandatory by the university or the examination regulation, it is considered necessary and is commonly practiced by the thesis supervisors. This indicates that the meeting is accepted as a superior procedure by the supervisors, making it a Best Practice. There is no indication that this relationship is due to a law of nature, as there is no inherent data, resource, or logical dependency that would prevent the second activity from preceding the first.

What is the relationship between [Write and submit proposal] and [Get registered by chair]?
The relationship between "Write and submit proposal" and "Get registered by chair" is a Business Rule. This is because the proposal requirement is set by each chair and not by the University, indicating that it is under the full jurisdiction of the chair, a stakeholder in the process. There is no indication of a law of nature dependency, as there is no inherent data, resource, or logical dependency preventing the second activity from preceding the first.

What is the relationship between [Submit thesis on Koinon] and [Present thesis in Colloquium]?
The relationship between "Submit thesis on Koinon" and "Present thesis in Colloquium" is classified as a Governmental Law.

This rule is enforced by the university and the Bavarian state ministry to regulate student behavior in the examination process. There is no indication of a law of nature dependency in this relationship.
