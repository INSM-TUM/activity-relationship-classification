{
    "First Activity": "Find a topic",
    "Second Activity": "Write and submit proposal",
    "Category": "-",
    "Justification": "-",
    "Law of Nature": "There is a data dependency between the two activities. You cannot write and submit a proposal without finding a topic first. The second activity thus depends on data from the first activity to proceed with the process."

{
    "First Activity": "Conduct topic-introduction meeting",
    "Second Activity": "Start writing",
    "Category": "Best Practice",
    "Justification": "In the interview with the supervisor, they say "I think it's not mandatory by the university, but it's necessary and what the supervisors usually do." therefore indicating that this introductory meeting is not mandated by the university or the examination regulation, but it is rather accepted by the thesis supervisors as a superior procedure, hence, a best practice.",

What is the relationship between [Write and submit proposal] and [Get registered by chair]?
{
    "First Activity": "Write and submit proposal",
    "Second Activity": "Get registered by chair",
    "Category": "Business Rule",
    "Justification": "Both the interviewed student and supervisor clearly say that the proposal is not required by the University but that it is a rule set by each chair, since some chairs do not require it before registering the student. This indicates that the relationship between the two activities is a business rule since it is a rule that is under the full jurisdiction of the chair, a stakeholder of the process.",

{
    "First Activity": "Submit thesis on Koinon",

    "Category": "Governmental Law",
    "Justification": "The examination regulations, set by the university and the Bavarian ministry, clearly states that the thesis must be submitted before the student can present it in the colloquium. This indicates that the relationship between the two activities is a governmental law since it is a rule created and enforced by the university and the Bavarian state ministry to regulate the behaviour of the students in the examination process.",
